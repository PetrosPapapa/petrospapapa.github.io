The project focused on the exploration of Explainable AI solutions for maintenance support, drawing from actual IoT data from Hitachi manufacturing sites.
Maintenance operations in large manufacturing machines are complex and require expert knowledge and experience. The goal of the project was to explore novel AI solutions that incorporate IoT data, knowledge and domain expertise.</description></item><item><title>DigiFlow</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/digiflow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 19:56:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/digiflow/</guid><description>Digitizing Industrial Workflow, Monitoring and Optimization Digiflow is an Industry 4.0 project funded by EIT Digital. It focuses on the digitization, monitoring, and optimization of industrial workflows, with a combination of IoT sensors, Cloud infrastructure and our workflow technologies.
A slide deck with some of the aspects and outputs of the project for 2018 can be found HERE
We are working on a unique solution to enable manufacturing companies to better monitor their floors and provide decision support towards efficiency optimisation:</description></item><item><title>SOCIAM</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/sociam/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 19:57:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/sociam/</guid><description>SOCIAM was an EPSRC funded project involving the Universities of Oxford, Edinburgh and Southampton, focusing on the theory and practice of social machines.
