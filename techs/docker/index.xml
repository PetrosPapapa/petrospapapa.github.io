Our first product was launched in the summer of 2016, a casino determined to deliver a better user and gaming experience than what is currently available. SuprNation is a highly ambitious project with 3 casino brands, VoodooDreams, NYSpins and Duelz live on the market.</description></item><item><title>Logic-based workflows</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proofs-as-processes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:28:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proofs-as-processes/</guid><description>This project aims to enhance the development of process workflows with AI techniques so that various properties of the models are verified as they are being built, i.e. workflows that are correct-by-construction.
In particular, we employ the proofs-as-processes paradigm which describes the correspondence between Classical Linear Logic (CLL) proofs with π-calculus processes. This enables us to create resource-based specifications of processes as logical sequents and compose them via formal proof. The result is a verified workflow with the following properties:</description></item><item><title>WorkflowFM Reasoner</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/reasoner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 19:32:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/reasoner/</guid><description>The WorkflowFM Reasoner is a logic-based library for correct-by-construction process modelling and composition.
It is available under the Apache 2.0 License on GitHub: https://github.com/workflowfm/workflowfm-reasoner
Website and documentation is available here: http://docs.workflowfm.com/workflowfm-reasoner/
About It is implemented as a logic-based library for the interactive theorem prover HOL Light that allows for rigorous, formally verified process specification and composition. The resulting workflows are correct-by-construction with the following verified properties:
Systematic resource accounting: No resources appear out of nowhere or disappear into thin air.</description></item><item><title>WorkflowFM Composer</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/composer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 19:32:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/composer/</guid><description>The WorkflowFM Composer is a a diagrammatic tool for formally verified process modelling and composition.
It is available under the Apache 2.0 License on GitHub: https://github.com/workflowfm/workflowfm-composer
Website and documentation is available here: http://docs.workflowfm.com/workflowfm-composer/
About The WorkflowFM Composer consists of a Java-based server and GUI for formally verified process composition using the WorkflowFM Reasoner. It provides a visual, diagrammatic interface to specify processes based on their input and output resources, and compose them together to form more complex workflows.</description></item><item><title>DigiFlow</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/digiflow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 19:56:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/digiflow/</guid><description>Digitizing Industrial Workflow, Monitoring and Optimization Digiflow is an Industry 4.0 project funded by EIT Digital. It focuses on the digitization, monitoring, and optimization of industrial workflows, with a combination of IoT sensors, Cloud infrastructure and our workflow technologies.
A slide deck with some of the aspects and outputs of the project for 2018 can be found HERE
We are working on a unique solution to enable manufacturing companies to better monitor their floors and provide decision support towards efficiency optimisation:</description></item></channel></rss>
