However, considerable effort is required to become accustomed to the system and to reach a point where one can comfortably achieve simple natural deduction proofs.
Isabelle is another powerful and widely used theorem prover that provides useful features for natural deduction proofs, including its meta-logic and its four main natural deduction tactics.</description></item></channel></rss>
