Our first product was launched in the summer of 2016, a casino determined to deliver a better user and gaming experience than what is currently available. SuprNation is a highly ambitious project with 3 casino brands, VoodooDreams, NYSpins and Duelz live on the market.</description></item><item><title>Logic-based workflows</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proofs-as-processes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:28:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proofs-as-processes/</guid><description>This project aims to enhance the development of process workflows with AI techniques so that various properties of the models are verified as they are being built, i.e. workflows that are correct-by-construction.
In particular, we employ the proofs-as-processes paradigm which describes the correspondence between Classical Linear Logic (CLL) proofs with œÄ-calculus processes. This enables us to create resource-based specifications of processes as logical sequents and compose them via formal proof. The result is a verified workflow with the following properties:</description></item><item><title>Cats-Actors</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/cats-actors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:22:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/cats-actors/</guid><description>Cats-Actors üê± is a functional programming-based actor system derived from Akka Akka v2.6.21.

Description The following text taken from the project README (original author: Mark Galea) introduces Cats-Actors, its main goal and benefits.
Introduction Actors are the fundamental units of computation in the Actor Model, encapsulating state and behavior. They interact exclusively through asynchronous message passing, ensuring their state is accessed sequentially.</description></item><item><title>Proter</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/proter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:22:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/proter/</guid><description>Proter is an open-source discrete event simulation library for workflows, written in Scala.

It focuses on the digitization, monitoring, and optimization of industrial workflows, with a combination of IoT sensors, Cloud infrastructure and our workflow technologies.
A slide deck with some of the aspects and outputs of the project for 2018 can be found HERE
We are working on a unique solution to enable manufacturing companies to better monitor their floors and provide decision support towards efficiency optimisation:</description></item><item><title>SOCIAM</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/sociam/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 19:57:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/sociam/</guid><description>SOCIAM was an EPSRC funded project involving the Universities of Oxford, Edinburgh and Southampton, focusing on the theory and practice of social machines.

We employ a rigorous methodology involving contextual interviews, questionnaires, and shadowing to capture the and record necessary knowledge. Using the logic-based tool WorkflowFM for this purpose offers the following advantages:
An intuitive, diagrammatic visualisation of the care pathways which helps clinicians better understand their own practices, analyse and rethink them.</description></item><item><title>Lightweight Social Calculus</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/lsc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 20:00:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/lsc/</guid><description>We would like to change the way in which social machines are built. The central premise is: there is a model of interaction which sits behind any social machine, governing who can do what when, which kinds of messages can be sent and to whom, shaping the ways in which the complex socio-technical system unfolds through time. However, these interaction models are often not explicit, transparent, editable, discoverable, composable and so on, as they are scattered through many interacting pieces of code.</description></item></channel></rss>
