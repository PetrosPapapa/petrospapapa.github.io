It is part of our WorkflowFM framework for formal workflow modelling and management.
It is available under the Apache 2.0 License on GitHub: https://github.com/workflowfm/proter
Website and documentation is available here: http://docs.workflowfm.com/proter/
Proter was initially developed for the simulation of logic-based workflows in WorkflowFM in the context of the DigiFlow project. It was then gradually sepHarated into an independent project for general purpose process simulation.</description></item><item><title>Business Process Simulation</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:07:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proter/</guid><description>Proter is an open-source discrete event simulation library for workflows, written in Scala.
