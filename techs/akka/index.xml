Our first product was launched in the summer of 2016, a casino determined to deliver a better user and gaming experience than what is currently available. SuprNation is a highly ambitious project with 3 casino brands, VoodooDreams, NYSpins and Duelz live on the market.</description></item><item><title>Logic-based workflows</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proofs-as-processes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:28:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proofs-as-processes/</guid><description>This project aims to enhance the development of process workflows with AI techniques so that various properties of the models are verified as they are being built, i.e. workflows that are correct-by-construction.
In particular, we employ the proofs-as-processes paradigm which describes the correspondence between Classical Linear Logic (CLL) proofs with œÄ-calculus processes. This enables us to create resource-based specifications of processes as logical sequents and compose them via formal proof. The result is a verified workflow with the following properties:</description></item><item><title>Cats-Actors</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/cats-actors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:22:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/cats-actors/</guid><description>Cats-Actors üê± is a functional programming-based actor system derived from Akka Akka v2.6.21.

Description The following text taken from the project README (original author: Mark Galea) introduces Cats-Actors, its main goal and benefits.
Introduction Actors are the fundamental units of computation in the Actor Model, encapsulating state and behavior. They interact exclusively through asynchronous message passing, ensuring their state is accessed sequentially.</description></item><item><title>Proter</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/proter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:22:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/proter/</guid><description>Proter is an open-source discrete event simulation library for workflows, written in Scala. It is part of our WorkflowFM framework for formal workflow modelling and management.
It is available under the Apache 2.0 License on GitHub: https://github.com/workflowfm/proter
Website and documentation is available here: http://docs.workflowfm.com/proter/
Proter was initially developed for the simulation of logic-based workflows in WorkflowFM in the context of the DigiFlow project. It was then gradually sepHarated into an independent project for general purpose process simulation.</description></item><item><title>Business Process Simulation</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:07:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/proter/</guid><description>Proter is an open-source discrete event simulation library for workflows, written in Scala.
