The project focused on the exploration of Explainable AI solutions for maintenance support, drawing from actual IoT data from Hitachi manufacturing sites.
Maintenance operations in large manufacturing machines are complex and require expert knowledge and experience. The goal of the project was to explore novel AI solutions that incorporate IoT data, knowledge and domain expertise.</description></item><item><title>SOCIAM</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/sociam/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 19:57:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/sociam/</guid><description>SOCIAM was an EPSRC funded project involving the Universities of Oxford, Edinburgh and Southampton, focusing on the theory and practice of social machines.

The official website contains detailed information about the numerous aspects, research topics, outputs, and applications of the project.
As a Research Associate, I was involved in a number of different research threads and (sub-)projects within SOCIAM.</description></item></channel></rss>
