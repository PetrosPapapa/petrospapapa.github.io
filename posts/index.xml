I have had ideas on a variety of topics, both technical, tutorial-like posts and opinion or personal pieces.
I have also had a lot of reasons why not to do it. What&amp;rsquo;s the point, it is not worth the time, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time, I have other priorities, and so on and so forth. At the end of the day, though, I just want to write because I like writing, I miss it and because I want to express myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
