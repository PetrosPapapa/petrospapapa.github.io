In particular, we employ the proofs-as-processes paradigm which describes the correspondence between Classical Linear Logic (CLL) proofs with œÄ-calculus processes. This enables us to create resource-based specifications of processes as logical sequents and compose them via formal proof. The result is a verified workflow with the following properties:</description></item><item><title>Cats-Actors</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/cats-actors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:22:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/cats-actors/</guid><description>Cats-Actors üê± is a functional programming-based actor system derived from Akka Akka v2.6.21.

What this library does Assuming you have an inductively defined logic encoded in HOL, the library allows you to prove object level theorems within your embedded logic.</description></item><item><title>Isabelle Light</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/isabelle-light/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:22:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/isabelle-light/</guid><description>HOL Light is a modern theorem proving system characterised by its powerful, low level interface that allows for flexibility and programmability. However, considerable effort is required to become accustomed to the system and to reach a point where one can comfortably achieve simple natural deduction proofs.
Isabelle is another powerful and widely used theorem prover that provides useful features for natural deduction proofs, including its meta-logic and its four main natural deduction tactics.</description></item><item><title>Boyer-Moore</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/boyer-moore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:22:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/boyer-moore/</guid><description>In this project, we investigate the potential of the Boyer-Moore waterfall model for the automation of inductive proofs within a modern proof assistant. Based on the concepts and methodology underlying this 40-year-old model, we have implemented a new, fully integrated tool in the theorem prover HOL Light that can be invoked as a tactic.
We have also included several extensions and enhancements to the model. These include the integration of existing HOL Light proof procedures and the addition of state-of-the-art generalization techniques into the waterfall.</description></item><item><title>HOL Light Tools</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/software/hol-light-tools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:22:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/software/hol-light-tools/</guid><description>This is a library of tools, tactics, and theories I have developed in HOL Light.
Some of these, such as the finite map theory, have been ported from the work of others, particularly in HOL4.
Notable things included:
A port of the finite map theory from HOL4. A set of tools to enable proofs in an arbitrarily extended proof state. A small library about substitution. Additional definitions and lemmas for lists, sets, multisets, etc.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Care Research Centre</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/acrc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 02:29:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/acrc/</guid><description>The Advanced Care Research Centre Programme is a complementary programme of research and development to deliver innovation and change to later life care.

The central premise is: there is a model of interaction which sits behind any social machine, governing who can do what when, which kinds of messages can be sent and to whom, shaping the ways in which the complex socio-technical system unfolds through time. However, these interaction models are often not explicit, transparent, editable, discoverable, composable and so on, as they are scattered through many interacting pieces of code.</description></item><item><title>Sociograms: Rapid assembly of Social Machines</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/sociograms/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:10:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/sociograms/</guid><description>Our goal is to create a methodology and a tool to design Social Machines using a graphical language (for now dubbed Sociograms) with executable semantics, in the sense that a (basic) working prototype can be automatically generated from a sociagram-based design.
Research questions include:
Can we describe (most) social machines as hypergraphs where nodes are actors and hyperedges are interaction protocols? Can a working prototype be automatically generated from such a structure and if not what additional constraints apply?</description></item><item><title>Healthcare Data Safe Havens</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/farr/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 17:51:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/farr/</guid><description>Healthcare Data Safe Havens allow the sharing of healthcare data in a secure infrastructure for extensive, data-intensive experiments being demanded by precision and stratified medicine. A key architectural challenge is how to maintain control of patient data within the governance of local data jurisdictions, while also allowing these jurisdictions to engage with experiment designs that (because of the need to scale to large population sizes) may require analyses across several jurisdictions.</description></item><item><title>Training Platform for Pulmonary Rehabilitation</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/copd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 17:50:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/copd/</guid><description>Image by Patrick J.

In COBIS, an effort is made to maintain burns data throughout Scotland and develop efficiency and quality indicators for burns care. The difficulty of these tasks is compounded by patient diversity (different patients require different care pathways), the low quality of existing guidelines, the number of different people that can be involved with the same patient, and the occasional digression from standard protocols.</description></item><item><title>Intra-hospital patient transfers</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/patient-transfers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 02:43:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/patient-transfers/</guid><description>We employed our rigorous workflow-based methodology to address safety issues of intra-hospital transfers. Particularly, we devised a framework for systematically generating electronic checklists for healthcare processes, and we applied it to intra-hospital transfers for tracheostomy procedures at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital, London. The resulting checklists are guaranteed to reflect the transfer workflows, enforce consistency and completeness, and thus provide enhanced confidence when it comes to patient safety.
Problem Intra-hospital transfers in the UK do not have well-defined guidelines, leading medical staff to employ informal, mostly oral-based means in order to support the transfers.</description></item><item><title>Patterns for collaborative work in healthcare</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/healthcare-collab/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 17:51:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/projects/healthcare-collab/</guid><description>We used our rigorous framework to formally verify the correctness of anumber of collaboration patterns in healthcare teams by looking at specifications of responsibility and accountability. Particularly, we analysed two types of patient handovers, which we modelled as process compositions that were then mechanically verified. The formal underpinning of our approach provides guarantees that all the necessary information for the patient handover is communicated, while enforcing the specified conditions for responsibility and accountability in every workflow instance.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Management &amp; Digital Consulting Mastercourse</title><link>https://www.petrospap.com/posts/celonis-mastercourse-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:03:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.petrospap.com/posts/celonis-mastercourse-2022/</guid><description>üì¢ 3 Week Mastercourse by Celonis - hosted by AIAI
